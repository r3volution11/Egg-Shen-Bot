## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- A Discord application and bot token
- API keys for:
  - TMDB (The Movie Database) - [Get free API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
  - OMDB (Optional Movie Database) - [Get API key](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
  - Trakt - [Get API key](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in your API keys and bot credentials:

   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key
   TRAKT_CLIENT_ID=your_trakt_client_id
   ```

## Setting Up Your Discord Bot

1. **Create a Discord Application**
   - Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Click "New Application" and give it a name
   - Navigate to the "Bot" section and click "Add Bot"
   - Copy the bot token and add it to your `.env` file as `DISCORD_TOKEN`
   - Copy the Application ID from the "General Information" tab and add it as `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`

2. **Configure Bot Permissions**
   - In the "Bot" section, enable these Privileged Gateway Intents (if needed):
     - Presence Intent (optional)
     - Server Members Intent (optional)
     - Message Content Intent (optional)
   - Under "OAuth2" > "URL Generator":
     - Select scope: `bot` and `applications.commands`
     - Select permissions: `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Read Messages/View Channels`
     - Copy the generated URL and use it to invite the bot to your server

3. **Deploy Slash Commands**

   ```bash
   npm run deploy-commands
   ```

   This registers the bot's slash commands with Discord (`/movie`, `/tv`, `/episode`, `/eggshen-help`, `/eggshen-config`). For faster testing, you can set `GUILD_ID` in your `.env` to deploy commands to a specific server (updates instantly). Leave it empty for global commands (takes up to 1 hour).

## Running the Bot

**Development mode (with auto-restart):**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production mode:**

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:

```
✓ Loaded command: movie
✓ Loaded command: tv
✓ Logged in as YourBot#1234
✓ Serving X guilds
```

**Note:** Administrators and moderators always have access to all commands, regardless of permission settings.

**Restart the Bot:**

```
/eggshen-restart
```

Gracefully restart the bot process. This command:

- Exits the bot process cleanly
- Requires a process manager (PM2, systemd, etc.) to automatically restart the bot
- Logs who initiated the restart
- Sends a confirmation message before restarting

**⚠️ Important:** This command only works if you're running the bot with a process manager like PM2 (recommended) or systemd. If running with `npm start`, the bot will exit but won't automatically restart.
